# Quick Fix - Upload These Files

## Critical Issue
CORS headers are not being sent because `public/index.php` is checking for `$_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN']` which might be null.

## Solution
Updated `public/index.php` to ALWAYS send CORS headers.

## Files to Upload

### 1. Upload this file IMMEDIATELY:
```
Back-End/public/index.php
```

### 2. Upload these if not already done:
```
Back-End/routes/api.php
Back-End/config/cors.php
```

## After Upload

Run these commands on your server:

```bash
cd /path/to/api  # (or wherever your API files are)
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

## Test the Fix

Open browser console and refresh https://www.bnbatiment.com

You should see NO MORE CORS errors!

## Quick Test Command

Test if CORS headers are now being sent:

```bash
curl -H "Origin: https://www.bnbatiment.com" \
     -I https://api.bnbatiment.com/api/test-cors
```

Look for these headers in the response:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.bnbatiment.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH
```

If you see these headers, CORS is fixed! âœ…

## What Changed

The key fix is that `public/index.php` now ALWAYS sets CORS headers on EVERY response, not just when an Origin header is present.

**Before:** Only set headers if origin matches
**After:** ALWAYS set headers (with proper origin matching)

This ensures browsers always get the CORS headers they need.
