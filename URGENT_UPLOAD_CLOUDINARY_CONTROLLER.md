# 🚨 URGENT: Upload Cloudinary Controller to Fix Error

## The Problem
You're getting "Failed to upload image: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"  
This means the **CloudinaryController.php file is not on the production server**, so the server is returning an HTML error page instead of JSON.

## ✅ Fix This Now

### Upload this file to production:

**Local File:**  
`Back-End/app/Http/Controllers/Api/CloudinaryUploadController.php`

**Upload to:**  
`/home/u696043789/domains/bnbatiment.com/public_html/api/Back-End/app/Http/Controllers/Api/CloudinaryUploadController.php`

## 📤 How to Upload

### Option 1: Via File Manager
1. Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/
2. File Manager
3. Navigate to: `domains/bnbatiment.com/public_html/api/Back-End/app/Http/Controllers/Api/`
4. Upload: `CloudinaryUploadController.php`

### Option 2: Via SSH
```bash
# Copy the file to the server using SCP or FTP
# Then SSH into the server and run:

cd /home/u696043789/domains/bnbatiment.com/public_html/api/Back-End
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

## ✅ After Uploading

1. The upload button will work
2. No more "Unexpected token" error
3. Images upload to Cloudinary successfully

## 🔍 Verify It Works

1. Go to: https://www.bnbatiment.com/admin/services
2. Click "Add Service"
3. Click "Upload from device"
4. Select an image
5. Should upload successfully!

## 📝 Note

If you still get errors after uploading, run on server:
```bash
cd /home/u696043789/domains/bnbatiment.com/public_html/api/Back-End
cat .env | grep CLOUDINARY
```

Should show:
```
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://667964626244861:Q-W2KrzSH4wMSTxYlvgSmBAG77s@dxyczvtd1
