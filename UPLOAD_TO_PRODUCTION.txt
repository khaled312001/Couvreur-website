URGENT: Upload These Files to Production Server
===========================================================

The server is returning 500 errors because the updated files aren't on production.

STEP 1: Upload this file to production via SSH or FTP

File to upload:
Back-End/app/Http/Controllers/Api/CloudinaryUploadController.php

Destination on server:
/home/u696043789/domains/bnbatiment.com/public_html/api/Back-End/app/Http/Controllers/Api/CloudinaryUploadController.php

STEP 2: Upload the frontend (rebuild first!)

File to upload after building:
Front-End/src/pages/Admin/ServicesAdmin.jsx

Then rebuild:
cd Front-End
npm run build

STEP 3: After uploading, SSH into server and run:

cd /home/u696043789/domains/bnbatiment.com/public_html/api/Back-End
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear

===========================================================

OR USE THE URL INPUT INSTEAD (it already works!)
The URL input option works perfectly and doesn't require the Cloudinary backend.
