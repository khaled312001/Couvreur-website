# Fixes Applied to Resolve Console Issues

## Issues Identified

1. **Mixed Content Warnings**: The page was loaded over HTTPS but trying to request insecure HTTP elements
2. **Image Loading Failures**: Images were failing to load with 404 errors and connection refused errors due to incorrect URL construction
3. **Multiple API calls**: Redundant API calls were being made by different components
4. **Excessive Console Logging**: Too much console output was cluttering the browser console

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Image URL Construction (`Front-End/src/utils/imageUtils.js`)

**Problem**: Images were being constructed with `localhost:8000` instead of the production API URL.

**Solution**: 
- Changed the base URL from using `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL?.replace('/api', '')` to hardcoded `'https://api.bnbatiment.com'`
- This ensures images are always loaded from the production server instead of localhost

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before
const laravelBaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL?.replace('/api', '') || 'https://api.bnbatiment.com';

// After
const productionBaseUrl = 'https://api.bnbatiment.com';
```

### 2. Optimized API Calls (`Front-End/src/pages/Home.jsx`)

**Problem**: The Home component was making redundant API calls - one in the main useEffect and another for contact form services.

**Solution**: 
- Combined the two useEffect hooks into one
- Now both the main services data and contact form services are loaded in a single API call
- Reduced the number of API calls from 2 to 1 for services

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: Two separate useEffect hooks
useEffect(() => {
  // Load main data
  const [servicesData, galleryData, testimonialsData, blogData] = await Promise.all([...]);
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  // Load contact services (duplicate call)
  const servicesData = await getServices();
}, []);

// After: Single useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const [servicesData, galleryData, testimonialsData, blogData] = await Promise.all([...]);
  setContactFormServices(servicesData); // Reuse the same data
}, []);
```

### 3. Reduced Console Logging

**Problem**: Excessive console logging was cluttering the browser console and making debugging difficult.

**Solution**: 
- Added conditional logging that only outputs in development mode
- Applied to multiple files:
  - `Front-End/src/api/apiClient.js`
  - `Front-End/src/components/Header.jsx`
  - `Front-End/src/pages/Home.jsx`
  - `Front-End/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
  - `Front-End/src/api/auth.js`

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Before
console.log('apiClient: Making request to:', url);

// After
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('apiClient: Making request to:', url);
}
```

### 4. Fixed Mixed Content Issues

**Problem**: The application was trying to load HTTP resources over HTTPS, causing mixed content warnings.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the `getImageUrl` function to force HTTPS for all URLs
- Added proper URL sanitization to prevent mixed content issues

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Force HTTPS for mixed content issues
const secureUrl = imagePath.replace('http://', 'https://');
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **No more Mixed Content Warnings**: All resources will be loaded over HTTPS
2. **Images should load correctly**: Images will be fetched from the production API URL
3. **Reduced API calls**: Fewer redundant requests will be made
4. **Cleaner console**: Only development-related logs will appear in production
5. **Better performance**: Reduced network requests and cleaner logging

## Testing

A test file has been created at `Front-End/test_image_loading.html` to verify that image loading is working correctly with the production API URL.

## Files Modified

1. `Front-End/src/utils/imageUtils.js` - Fixed image URL construction
2. `Front-End/src/pages/Home.jsx` - Optimized API calls and reduced logging
3. `Front-End/src/api/apiClient.js` - Reduced console logging
4. `Front-End/src/components/Header.jsx` - Reduced console logging
5. `Front-End/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Reduced console logging
6. `Front-End/src/api/auth.js` - Reduced console logging
7. `Front-End/test_image_loading.html` - Created test file for verification

## Next Steps

1. Test the application in production to verify all fixes are working
2. Monitor the console for any remaining issues
3. Consider implementing a shared state management solution (like React Context) to further reduce redundant API calls across components
